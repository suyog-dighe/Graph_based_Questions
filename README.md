# Graph_based_Questions
This repository contains implementations of various graph algorithms and solutions to graph-based questions. Each file addresses a specific problem or algorithm related to graph theory, useful for both academic purposes and practical applications.

List of Files
**1) BFS.java :-**
Implements the Breadth-First Search algorithm for graph traversal.

**2) BellmanFord.java :-**
Solves the shortest path problem using the Bellman-Ford algorithm, which works even if the graph has negative weight edges.

**3) CheapestFlight_KStops.java :-**
Finds the cheapest flight route with up to K stops between cities using a modified BFS algorithm.

**4) ConnectCities.java :-**
Uses graph theory to determine the minimum cost to connect all cities.

**5) DFS.java :-**
Implements the Depth-First Search algorithm for graph traversal.

**6) DetectCycle.java :-**
Detects cycles in a graph using Depth-First Search.

**7) Dijkstra_Algo.java :-**
Implements Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest paths from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph.

**8) Find_Union.java :-**
Implements the Union-Find data structure to manage a partition of a set into disjoint sets, useful for cycle detection in undirected graphs.

**9) HasPath.java :-**
Determines if there is a path between two nodes in a graph.

**10) Indegree.java :-**
Calculates the indegree of each node in a directed graph.

**11) IsBiPartite.java :-**
Checks if a graph is bipartite using BFS or DFS.

**12) Kruskals_Algo.java :-**
Implements Kruskal's algorithm for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a graph.

**13) LargestSumCycle.java :-**
Finds the largest sum cycle in a weighted directed graph.

**14) Prims_Algo.java :-**
Implements Prim's algorithm for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a graph.

**15) PrintAllPath.java :-**
Prints all possible paths between two nodes in a graph.

**16) Simple.java :-**
Solves a simple graph-based question (specifics to be detailed in the code).

**17) Topological_Sort.java :-**
Implements topological sorting for a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).

**18) isCycle_DFS.java :-**
Detects cycles in a graph using DFS.

**Usage**
Each Java file can be compiled and run independently. To compile a file, use the following command in the terminal:

To run the compiled file, use:

**javac filename.java**

**java filename**

Replace <filename> with the name of the file you want to compile and run.
